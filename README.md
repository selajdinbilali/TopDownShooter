unity tutorial found on Sebastian Lague youtube channel [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SviIeTt2_Lc&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ctd4dgE1F8g3uec4zKNRV0)

I am doing this tutorial to better understand unity and I am adding my comments to make it easy to learn for me.
I may not exactly follow the tutorial for some little things like name variables or some refactoring.
